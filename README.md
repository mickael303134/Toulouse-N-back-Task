# Toulouse-N-back-Task

The Toulouse N-Back is a cognitive test designed to measure an individual's working memory and arithmetic ability. It is useful for generating a high mental workload in populations whose cognitive abilities are considered to be above the average of the general population (pilots, ATCOs...). The high difficulty of this task avoids the phenomenon of performance plateau. In this task, the person has to observe a sequence of arithmetic operations (e.g., 15 + 5) which are presented on the screen one after the other. Each time a new stimulus is presented, the individual must perform the arithmetic operation and indicate whether the result of this operation matches the result of the arithmetic operation presented "n" positions back in the sequence.

The value of "n" can be changed (e.g. 1, 2, 3) according to the desired level of difficulty. The difficulty of the calculations can also be changed.

The exercise is available in MATLAB and PEBL.
